### Description

The Electronics Marketplace is a single-page application (SPA) designed for buying laptops and accessories. You’ll find an extensive selection of products, catering to all your tech needs. Whether you're looking for the latest laptops or essential accessories, we've got you covered.

When you log in, you can also contribute to the marketplace by adding your own products, making it easy to share your offerings with others. Enjoy a seamless shopping experience as you browse, compare, and purchase items, all in one convenient place.

### Tech

Electronics Marketplace uses a number of open-source projects to work:
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - Free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/index.html) - Elegant MongoDB object modelling for NodeJS
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Evented I/O for the backend
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for NodeJS
* [JSONWebToken](https://jwt.io) - Used for authorization
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack. In this project, I’ve utilized:

* JWT authentication
* Unit testing
* Rest API
* GraphQL
* React Hooks
* Context API

### Installation

The project requires:
